# Gift-BE

A RESTful backend service built with **Express** and **TypeScript**. This project demonstrates core backend concepts such as routing, middleware, validation, and database interaction using **PostgreSQL**. It serves as a showcase of my backend development skills.

---

## Technologies

- **Express** for building the REST API.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience.
- **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- **bcrypt** for password hashing.
- **Zod** for schema validation.
- **Nodemon** for hot-reloading during development.
- **dotenv** for managing environment variables.
